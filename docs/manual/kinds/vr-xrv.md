# -{{ kind_display_name }}-
-{{ kind_display_name }}- virtualized router is identified with `-{{ kind_code_name }}-` kind in the [topology file](../topo-def-file.md).
It is built using [vrnetlab](../vrnetlab.md) project and essentially is a Qemu VM packaged in a docker container format.


-{{ kind_display_name }}- nodes launched with containerlab come up pre-provisioned with SSH, SNMP, NETCONF and gNMI (if available) services enabled.

!!!warning
    XRv image is discontinued by Cisco and superseded by XRv 9000 image. It was added to containerlab because the image is lightweight, compared to XRv9k. If recent features are needed, use [Cisco XRv9k](vr-xrv9k.md) kind.

## Managing -{{ kind_display_name }}- nodes

!!!note
    Containers with XRv inside will take ~5min to fully boot.  
    You can monitor the progress with `docker logs -f <container-name>`.

Cisco XRv node launched with containerlab can be managed via the following interfaces:

=== "bash"
    to connect to a `bash` shell of a running Cisco XRv container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name/id> bash
    ```
=== "CLI via SSH"
    to connect to the XRv CLI
    ```bash
    ssh clab@<container-name/id>
    ```
=== "NETCONF"
    NETCONF server is running over port 830
    ```bash
    ssh clab@<container-name> -p 830 -s netconf
    ```
=== "gNMI"
    using the best in class [gnmic](https://gnmic.openconfig.net/) gNMI client as an example:
    ```bash
    gnmic -a <container-name/node-mgmt-address> --insecure \
    -u clab -p clab@123 \
    capabilities
    ```

!!!info
    Default user credentials: `clab:clab@123`

## Interface naming

Cisco XRv nodes use the interface naming convention `GigabitEthernet0/0/0/X` (or `Gi0/0/0/X`, both are accepted), where X denotes the port number.

!!!info
    Data port numbering starts at `0`, like one would normally expect in the NOS.

## Interfaces mapping

Cisco XRv container can have up to 90 interfaces and uses the following mapping rules:

* `eth0` - management interface connected to the containerlab management network
* `eth1` - first data interface, mapped to first data port of XRv line card
* `eth2+` - second and subsequent data interface

When containerlab launches Cisco XRv node, it will assign IPv4/6 address to the `eth0` interface. These addresses can be used to reach management plane of the router.

Data interfaces `eth1+` needs to be configured with IP addressing manually using CLI/management protocols.

## Features and options

### Node configuration

Cisco XRv nodes come up with a basic configuration where only the control plane and line cards are provisioned, as well as the `clab` user and management interfaces such as NETCONF, SNMP, gNMI.

#### Startup configuration

It is possible to make XRv nodes boot up with a user-defined startup-config instead of a built-in one. With a [`startup-config`](../nodes.md#startup-config) property of the node/kind user sets the path to the config file that will be mounted to a container and used as a startup-config:

```yaml
topology:
  nodes:
    node:
      kind: -{{ kind_code_name }}-
      startup-config: myconfig.txt
```

With this knob containerlab is instructed to take a file `myconfig.txt` from the directory that hosts the topology file, and copy it to the lab directory for that specific node under the `/config/startup-config.cfg` name. Then the directory that hosts the startup-config dir is mounted to the container. This will result in this config being applied at startup by the node.

Configuration is applied after the node is started, thus it can contain partial configuration snippets that you desire to add on top of the default config that a node boots up with.

## Lab examples

The following labs feature Cisco XRv node:

* [SR Linux and Cisco XRv](../../lab-examples/vr-xrv.md)

## Known issues and limitations

* LACP and BPDU packets are not propagated to/from vrnetlab based routers launched with containerlab.
