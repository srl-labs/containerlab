# Nokia SR Linux

[Nokia SR Linux](https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/service-router-linux-NOS/) NOS is identified with `nokia_srlinux` kind in the [topology file](../topo-def-file.md). A kind defines a supported feature set and a startup procedure of a node.

## Getting SR Linux image

Nokia SR Linux is the first commercial Network OS with a free and open distribution model. Everyone can pull SR Linux container from a public registry:

```bash
# pull latest available release
docker pull ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux
```

To pull a specific version, use tags that match the released version and are listed in the [srlinux-container-image](https://github.com/nokia/srlinux-container-image) repo.

//// admonition | ARM64-native SR Linux container image
    type: tip
SR Linux Network OS is also available as an ARM64-native container image in a preview mode. The preview mode means that some issues may be present, as the image is not yet fully qualified.

Starting with SR Linux 24.10.1 the container image is built using the manifest list, so when you pull the image, the correct architecture is selected automatically.

ARM64 image unlocks running networking labs on [Apple macOS](../../macos.md) with M-chips, as well as cloud instances with ARM64 architecture and on new Microsoft Surface laptops.

## Managing SR Linux nodes

There are many ways to manage SR Linux nodes, ranging from classic CLI management all the way up to the gNMI programming.

/// tab | bash
to connect to a `bash` shell of a running SR Linux container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name/id> bash
```

///

/// tab | CLI/SSH
to connect to the SR Linux CLI

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name/id> sr_cli
```  

or with SSH `ssh admin@<container-name>`
///
/// tab | gNMI
using the best in class [gnmic](https://gnmic.openconfig.net/) gNMI client as an example:

```bash
gnmic -a <container-name/node-mgmt-address> --skip-verify \
-u admin -p "NokiaSrl1!" \
-e json_ietf \
get --path /system/name/host-name
```

///
/// tab | JSON-RPC
SR Linux has a JSON-RPC interface running over ports 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS schemas.

HTTPS server uses the same TLS certificate as gNMI server.

Here is an example of getting version information with JSON-RPC:

```shell
curl http://admin:admin@clab-srl-srl/jsonrpc -d @- << EOF
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "method": "get",
    "params":
    {
        "commands":
        [
            {
                "path": "/system/information/version",
                "datastore": "state"
            }
        ]
    }
}
EOF
```

///
/// tab | SNMP
SR Linux nodes come up with SNMPv2 server enabled and running on port 161. The default SNMP community is `public`.

```shell
docker run -i -t ghcr.io/hellt/net-snmp-tools:5.9.4-r0 \
  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public <node-name>
```

///

/// tab | NETCONF
From SR Linux release 24.7.1 onwards, SR Linux comes with NETCONF server enabled and running on port 830.

Using [netconf-console2](https://github.com/hellt/netconf-console2-container):

```bash
docker run --rm --network clab -i -t \
ghcr.io/hellt/netconf-console2:3.0.1 \
--host <node-name> --port 830 -u admin -p 'NokiaSrl1!' \
--hello
```

///

### Credentials

Default credentials[^1]: `admin:NokiaSrl1!`

Containerlab will automatically enable public-key authentication for `root`, `admin` and `linuxadmin` users if public key files are found at `~/.ssh` directory[^2].

## Interfaces naming

You can use [interfaces names](../topo-def-file.md#interface-naming) in the topology file like they appear in SR Linux.

The interface naming convention is: `ethernet-1/Y`, where `1` is the only available line card and `Y` is the port on the line card.

With that naming convention in mind:

* `ethernet-1/1` - first ethernet interface on line card 1
* `ethernet-1/2` - second interface on line card 1

As an example:

```yaml
  links:
    # srlinux port ethernet-1/3 is connected to vsrx port ge-0/0/3
    - endpoints: ["srlinux:ethernet-1/3", "vsrx:ge-0/0/3"]
    # srlinux port ethernet-1/5 is connected to sros port 2
    - endpoints: ["srlinux:ethernet-1/5", "sros:1/1/2"]
```

SR Linux system expects interfaces inside the container to be named in a specific way - `e1-Y` - where `1` is the only available line card and `Y` is the port on the line card, however, it is optional (but still fully supported) to use this internal naming convention in Containerlab topologies.

The example ports above would be mapped to the following Linux interfaces:

* `e1-1` - first ethernet interface on line card 1
* `e1-2` - second interface on line card 1

### Breakout interfaces

You can also use breakout (or channelised) interfaces on SR Linux nodes.

```yaml
  links:
    # srlinux's first breakout port ethernet-1/3/1
    # is connected to sros port 2
    - endpoints: ["srlinux:ethernet-1/3/1", "sros:1/1/2"]
    # srlinux's second breakout port ethernet-1/3/2
    # is connected to vEOS port Et1/2
    - endpoints: ["srlinux:ethernet-1/3/2", "veos:Et1/2"]
```

The breakout interfaces will have the mapped Linux interface name `eX-Y-Z` where `Z` is the breakout port number. For example, if interface `ethernet-1/3` on an IXR-D3 system is meant to act as a breakout 100Gb to 4x25Gb, and the first breakout port is used in the topology (`ethernet-1/3/1`), then the mapped interfaces in the container will be called `e1-3-1`.

## Features and options

### Types

For SR Linux nodes [`type`](../nodes.md#type) defines the hardware variant that this node will emulate.

The available 7220 IXR models support the following types: `ixrd1`, `ixrd2`, `ixrd3`, `ixrd2l`, `ixrd3l`, `ixrd4`, `ixrd5`, `ixrh2`, `ixrh3` and `ixrh4`.

Nokia 7250 IXR chassis identified with types `ixr6e`, `ixr10e`, `ixrx3b` and `ixrx1b` require a valid license to operate.

If type is not set in the clab file `ixrd2` value will be used by containerlab.

Based on the provided type, containerlab will generate the topology file that will be mounted to the SR Linux container and make it boot in a chosen HW variant.

### Node configuration

SR Linux uses a `/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json` file to persist its configuration. By default, containerlab starts nodes of `srl` kind with a basic "default" config, and with the `startup-config` parameter, it is possible to provide a custom config file that will be used as a startup one.

#### Default node configuration

When a node is defined without the `startup-config` statement present, containerlab will make [additional configurations](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/blob/main/nodes/srl/srl_default_config.go.tpl) on top of the factory config:

```yaml
# example of a topo file that does not define a custom startup-config
# as a result, the default configuration will be used by this node

name: srl_lab
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: nokia_srlinux
      type: ixrd3
```

The rendered config can be found at `/tmp/clab-default-config` path on SR Linux filesystem and will be saved by the path `clab-<lab_name>/<node-name>/config/config.json`. Using the example topology presented above, the exact path to the config will be `clab-srl_lab/srl1/config/config.json`.

Additional configurations that containerlab adds on top of the factory config:

* enabling interfaces (`admin-state enable`) referenced in the topology's `links` section
* enabling LLDP
* enabling gNMI/gNOI/JSON-RPC as well as enabling unix-socket access for gRPC services
* creating tls server certificate
* setting `mgmt0 subinterface 0 ip-mtu` to the MTU value of the underlying container runtime network

A configuration checkpoint named `clab-initial` is generated by containerlab once default and user-provided configs are applied. The checkpoint may be used to quickly revert configuration changes made by a user to a state that was present after the node was started.

#### User defined startup config

It is possible to make SR Linux nodes boot up with a user-defined config instead of a built-in one. With a [`startup-config`](../nodes.md#startup-config) property of the node/kind a user sets the path to the local config file that will be used as a startup config.

The startup configuration file can be provided in two formats:

* full SR Linux config in JSON format
* partial config in SR Linux CLI format

##### CLI

A typical lab scenario is to make nodes boot with a pre-configured use case. The easiest way to do that is to capture the intended changes as CLI commands.

On SR Linux, users can configure the system and capture the changes in the form of CLI instructions using the `info` command. These CLI commands can be saved in a file[^3] and used as a startup configuration.

/// details | CLI config examples

//// tab | Regular config

```bash
network-instance default {
    interface ethernet-1/1.0 {
    }
    interface ethernet-1/2.0 {
    }
    protocols {
        bgp {
            admin-state enable
            autonomous-system 65001
            router-id 10.0.0.1
            group rs {
                peer-as 65003
                ipv4-unicast {
                    admin-state enable
                }
            }
            neighbor 192.168.13.2 {
                peer-group rs
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
set / network-instance default protocols bgp admin-state enable

```

////
///

```yaml
name: srl_lab
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: nokia_srlinux
      type: ixrd3
      image: ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux
      # a path to the partial config in CLI format relative to the current working directory
      startup-config: myconfig.cli
```

In that case, SR Linux will first boot with the default configuration, and then the CLI commands from the `myconfig.cli` will be applied. Note, that no entering into the candidate config, nor explicit commit is required to be part of the CLI configuration snippets.

##### JSON

SR Linux persists its configuration as a JSON file that can be found by the `/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json` path. Users can use this file as a startup configuration like that:

```yaml
name: srl_lab
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: nokia_srlinux
      type: ixrd3
      image: ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux
      # a path to the full config in JSON format relative to the current working directory
      startup-config: myconfig.json
```

Containerlab will take the `myconfig.json` file, copy it to the lab directory for that specific node under the `config.json` name, and mount that directory to the container. This will result in this config acting as a startup-config for the node.

#### Saving configuration

As was explained in the [Node configuration](#node-configuration) section, SR Linux containers can make their config persistent because config files are provided to the containers from the host via the bind mount.

When a user configures the SR Linux node, the changes are saved into the running configuration stored in memory. To save the running configuration as a startup configuration, the user needs to execute the `tools system configuration save` CLI command. This command will write the config to the `/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json` file that holds the startup-config and is exposed to the host.

SR Linux node also supports the [`containerlab save -t <topo-file>`](../../cmd/save.md) command, which will execute the command to save the running-config on all lab nodes. For SR Linux node, the `tools system configuration save` will be executed:

```
❯ containerlab save -t quickstart.clab.yml
INFO[0000] Parsing & checking topology file: quickstart.clab.yml
INFO[0001] saved SR Linux configuration from leaf1 node. Output:
/system:
    Saved current running configuration as initial (startup) configuration '/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json'

INFO[0001] saved SR Linux configuration from leaf2 node. Output:
/system:
    Saved current running configuration as initial (startup) configuration '/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json'
```

### TLS

By default, containerlab will generate TLS certificates and keys for each SR Linux node of a lab. The TLS-related files that containerlab creates are located in the TLS directory, which can be found by the `<lab-directory>/.tls/` path. Here is a list of files that containerlab creates relative to the TLS directory:

1. CA certificate - `./ca/ca.pem`
2. CA private key - `./ca/ca.key`
3. Node certificate - `./<node-name>/<node-name>.pem`
4. Node private key - `./<node-name>/<node-name>.key`

The generated TLS files will persist between lab deployments. This means that if you destroyed a lab and deployed it again, the TLS files from the initial lab deployment will be used.

In case user-provided certificates/keys need to be used, the `ca.pem`, `<node-name>.pem` and `<node-name>.key` files must be copied by the paths outlined above for containerlab to take them into account when deploying a lab.

In case only `ca.pem` and `ca.key` files are provided, the node certificates will be generated using these CA files.

The certificate is generated for the following subjects (assuming node name is `srl`, lab name is `srl` and container runtime assigned the below listed IP addresses):

```
DNS:srl
DNS:clab-srl-srl
DNS:srl.srl.io
IP Address:172.20.20.3, IP Address:3fff:172:20:20:0:0:0:3
```

Nokia SR Linux nodes support setting of [SANs](../nodes.md#subject-alternative-names-san).

### gRPC server

Starting with SR Linux 24.3.1, the gRPC server config block is used to configure gRPC-based services such as gNMI, gNOI, gRIBI and P4RT. The factory configuration includes the `mgmt` gRPC server block to which containerlab adds all those services and:

* generated TLS profile - `clab-profile`
* unix-socket access for gRPC services
* increased rate limit
* trace options

These additions are meant to make all gRPC services available to the user out of the box with the enabled tracing and a custom TLS profile.

Besides augmenting the factory-provided `mgmt` gRPC server block, containerlab also adds a new `insecure-mgmt` gRPC server that provides the same services as the `mgmt` server but without TLS. This server runs on port 57401 and is meant to be used for testing purposes as well as for local gNMI clients running as part of the NDK apps or local Event Handler scripts.

#### EDA support

To ensure that Containerlab-provisioned SR Linux nodes can be managed by Nokia EDA a set of gRPC servers is added:

* `eda-discovery` - provides support for EDA discovery
* `eda-mgmt` - gRPC server that references `EDA` TLS security profile that EDA setups with gNSI
* `eda-insecure-mgmt` - insecure version of the `eda-mgmt` gRPC server

### SSH Keys

Containerlab will read the public keys found in `~/.ssh` directory of a sudo user as well as the contents of a `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file if it exists[^4]. The public keys will be added to the startup configuration for `admin` and `linuxadmin` users to enable passwordless access.

### NETCONF

Containerlab will configure the `netconf-mgmt` ssh server running over port 830 and the netconf-server instance using this SSH server to enable NETCONF management.

### License

SR Linux container can run without a license emulating the datacenter types (7220 IXR) :partying_face:.  
In that license-less mode, the datapath is limited to 1000 PPS and the `sr_linux` process will restart once a week.

The license file lifts these limitations as well as unlocks chassis-based platform variants and a path to it can be provided with [`license`](../nodes.md#license) directive.

## Container configuration

To start an SR Linux NOS containerlab uses the configuration that is described in SR Linux Software Installation Guide

/// tab | Startup command
`sudo bash -c /opt/srlinux/bin/sr_linux`
///
/// tab | Syscalls

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = "0"
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = "0"
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_dad = "0"
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_dad = "0"
net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf = "0"
net.ipv6.conf.default.autoconf = "0"
```

///
/// tab | Environment variables
`SRLINUX=1`
///

### File mounts

When a user starts a lab, containerlab creates a lab directory for storing [configuration artifacts](../conf-artifacts.md). For `nokia_srlinux` kind, containerlab creates directories for each node of that kind.

```
~/clab/clab-srl02
❯ ls -lah srl1
drwxrwxrwx+ 6 1002 1002   87 Dec  1 22:11 config
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  233 Dec  1 22:11 topology.clab.yml
```

The `config` directory is mounted to container's `/etc/opt/srlinux/` path in `rw` mode. It will contain configuration that SR Linux runs of as well as the files that SR Linux keeps in its `/etc/opt/srlinux/` directory:

```
❯ ls srl1/config
banner  cli  config.json  devices  tls  ztp
```

The topology file that defines the emulated hardware type is driven by the value of the kinds `type` parameter. Depending on a specified `type`, the appropriate content will be populated into the `topology.yml` file that will get mounted to `/tmp/topology.yml` directory inside the container in `ro` mode.

#### YUM/APT repositories

Containerlab will create and mount repository files for YUM and APT to ensure that SR Linux users can install packages from the aforementioned repos.

The repo files are mounted to the following paths:

* `/etc/yum.repos.d/srlinux.repo` - for YUM package manager (used in SR Linux releases prior to 23.10)
* `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/srlinux.list` - for APT package manager

### DNS configuration

SR Linux's management stack lives in a separate network namespace `srbase-mgmt`. Due to this fact, the DNS resolver provided by Docker in the root network namespace is not available to the SR Linux management stack.

To enable DNS resolution for SR Linux, containerlab will extract the DNS servers configured on the host system from

* `/etc/resolv.conf`
* `run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf`

files and configure IP addresses found there as DNS servers in the management network instance of SR Linux:

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:srl# info system dns  
    system {
        dns {
            network-instance mgmt
            server-list [
                # these servers were extracted from the host
                # and provisioned by containerlab
                10.171.10.1
                10.171.10.2
            ]
        }
    }
```

If you wish to turn off the automatic DNS provisioning, set the `servers` list to an empty value in the [node configuration](../nodes.md#dns).

### ACL configuration

Starting with SR Linux 24.3.1 release, containerlab adds CPM filter rules to the default factory configuration to allow the following traffic:

* HTTP access over port 80 for v4 and v6
* Telnet access over port 23 for v4 and v6

These protocols were removed from the default factory configuration in SR Linux 24.3.1 as a security hardening measure, but they are valuable for lab environments, hence containerlab adds them back.

## Host Requirements

SR Linux is a containerized NOS, therefore it depends on the host's kernel and CPU. It is recommended to run a kernel v4 and newer, though it might also run on the older kernels.

### SSSE3 CPU set

SR Linux XDP - the emulated datapath based on DPDK - requires SSSE3 instructions to be available. This instruction set is present on most modern CPUs, but it is missing in the basic emulated CPUs created by hypervisors like QEMU, Proxmox. When this instruction set is not present in the host CPU set, containerlab will abort the lab deployment if it has SR Linux nodes defined.

The easiest way to enable SSSE3 instruction set is to configure the hypervisor to use the `host` CPU type, which exposes all available instructions to the guest. For Proxmox, this can be set in the GUI:

![proxmox](https://gitlab.com/rdodin/pics/-/wikis/uploads/c01dad79d8ab51fba77423f841d40378/image.png){: .img-shadow}

Or it's also possible via the proxmox configuration file `/etc/pve/qemu-server/vmid.conf`.

[^1]: Prior to SR Linux 22.11.1, the default credentials were `admin:admin`.
[^2]: The `authorized_keys` file will be created with the content of all found public keys. This file will be bind-mounted using the respecting paths inside SR Linux to enable password-less access. Experimental feature.
[^3]: CLI configs can be saved also in the "flat" format using `info flat` command.
[^4]: If running with `sudo`, add `-E` flag to sudo to preserve user' home directory for this feature to work as expected.
