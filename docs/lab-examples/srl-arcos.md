## Description

A lab consists of an SR Linux node connected with Arrcus ArcOS via a point-to-point ethernet link. Both nodes are also connected with their management interfaces to the `containerlab` docker network.

## Use cases

This lab allows users to launch basic interoperability scenarios between Nokia SR Linux and Arrcus ArcOS operating systems.

## Configuration

Both SR Linux and ArcOS nodes come with a startup config files referenced for them. These user-defined startup files introduce the following change on top of the default config that these nodes boot with:

* On SR Linux, interface `ethernet-1/1` is configured with `192.168.0.0/31` address and this interface attached to the default network instance.
* On ArcOS, interface `swp1` is configured with `192.168.0.1/31` address.

## Verification

When the deployment of the lab finishes, users can validate that the datapath works between the nodes by pinging the directly connected interfaces from either node.

Here is an example from SR Linux side:

```bash
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:admin@srl# ping network-instance default 192.168.0.1 -c 2
Using network instance default
PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.99 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.38 ms
