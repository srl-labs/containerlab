# Community

Containerlab openness and focus on multivendor labs were key to its success and adoption. With more than a dozen Network Operating Systems spread across several networking vendors and opensource teams, it is a tool that can answer the needs of a broad network engineers community.

## Chat servers

### Discord

Growing the number of supported NOSes is a task that can't be done by a single person, and there the community role is adamant. To support and cherish the growing containerlab community and provide better feedback and discussions platform, we launched containerlab's official Discord server where maintainers and users hang out.

Everybody is welcome to join and chat with our community members about all things containerlab!

<center>[:fontawesome-brands-discord: Join Containerlab Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vAyddtaEV9){ .md-button .md-button--primary }</center>

### IRC

For those who cherish IRC in their hearts, a community-led IRC channel `#containerlab` is available at [IRC Libera server](https://libera.chat/).

## In The Media

We are always happy to showcase containerlab and demonstrate its powers. Luckily, the network engineering community has lots of events worldwide, and we participated in some. Below you will find recordings of containerlab talks in different formats and on various venues listed in reverse chronological order[^1].

<small>:material-youtube: [Containerlab: Declarative network labbing](https://www.modem.show/post/s01e10/) · :material-calendar: 2021-06-06</small>

Building large-scale network labs can be tedious and error-prone — More importantly, they can be notoriously hard to spin up automatically. Containerlab is a new tool that promises to “redefine the way you run networking labs”, and I really think it hits that target. On this episode of the Modulate Demodulate podcast, Nick and Chris C. are joined by Roman Dodin, one of the brains behind Containerlab.

### Extending the Kubernetes (host) network with EVPN tunnels

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://fedepaol.github.io/blog/2024/06/14/extending-the-kubernetes-host-network-with-evpn-tunnels-and-frr/) by [Federico Paolinelli](https://fedepaol.github.io/about/) · :material-calendar: 2024-06-14</small>

It is refreshing to see how people find new ways to use containerlab. In this blog post, Federico Paolinelli explains how he used containerlab to create a lab environment to test a solution to extend the Kubernetes host network with EVPN tunnels and FRR.

Containerlab helped to build the lab environment where a KinD-based k8s cluster is connected to an EVPN emulated fabric. Thanks to the native KinD support in containerlab it was all a single lab package to deploy and test the solution.

### Using Containerlab and Google Cloud Platform to lab Aruba CX

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://blog.crispyfi.com/2024/06/02/aruba-cx-infrastructure-as-code-lab-with-containerlab-in-google-cloud-platform/) by [Crispy](https://blog.crispyfi.com/about/) · :material-calendar: 2024-06-02</small>

Crispy [shares his experience](https://blog.crispyfi.com/2024/06/02/aruba-cx-infrastructure-as-code-lab-with-containerlab-in-google-cloud-platform/) with switching from EVE-NG to Containerlab to lab Aruba CX switches.

### Containerlab for Kubernetes Networking Experimentation

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://virtualizestuff.com/exploring-containerlab) by [Dave Davis](https://hashnode.com/@Virtualizestuff) · :material-calendar: 2024-03-25</small>

Dave' opening paragraph sets the stage for the blog post:

> Recently, my focus has shifted towards Kubernetes, where I've been assisting customers in designing resilient and scalable clusters. I'm on the lookout for a tool that can quickly set up test Kubernetes clusters with diverse network topologies. Ideally the solution would offer version control, rapid deployments, Kubernetes support, and ease of sharing.

As you can see, containerlab fits this bill quite nicely. Dave goes on to [explain](https://virtualizestuff.com/exploring-containerlab) how he used containerlab to create a lab environment to test Kubernetes networking solutions.

### Powering up your Netbox labs with Containerlab

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://netboxlabs.com/blog/network-configuration-assurance-with-netbox-and-ansible/) by [Rich Bibby](https://netboxlabs.com/author/richard-bibby/) · :material-calendar: 2024-03-20</small>

Our friends at NetboxLabs have authored a nice blog post - Network Configuration Assurance With NetBox and Ansible - and they have used containerlab to create a lab environment to present their solution.

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://www.theasciiconstruct.com/post/multivendor-evpn-vxlan-l2-overlay/) by [@aninchat](https://twitter.com/aninchat) · :material-calendar: 2022-03-12</small>

In this post, we deploy a multivendor EVPN L2 overlay fabric, with BGP in the underlay as well. The entire fabric deployment is automated with Ansible, and Containerlab is used to define and deploy the actual topology.

### Network Simulation Tools and Containerlab

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://juliopdx.com/2022/02/13/network-simulation-tools-and-containerlab/) by [@JulioPDX](https://twitter.com/Julio_PDX) · :material-calendar: 2022-02-13</small>

I’ve been progressing through a series of technical books, some of which I’ve shared on other blogs. A few of them focus on BGP. BGP being so broad, I decided to create a challenge lab. Creating the challenge/troubleshooting labs has really made more concepts stick. I’m trying to use the principle of teaching someone to make the learning last. These have been incredibly fun to create and the community interaction has been amazing. One brave soul(Jeroen van Bemmel) shared his solution. I was fascinated on his solution and how he created his topology with Containerlab and net-sim tools.

### Juniper vQFX and containerlab

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://www.theasciiconstruct.com/post/junos-vqfx-containerlab/) by [@aninchat](https://twitter.com/aninchat) · :material-calendar: 2022-02-06</small>

In this post, we look at how Containerlab can be used to quickly spin up vQFX topologies for network validation and testing. We’ll walk through the entire process - how to build docker images from vQFX images, what happens behind the scenes when bringing these containers up and how to build/verify your topology.

### Multipoint Redistribution and SR Linux

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://juliopdx.com/2022/01/22/multipoint-redistribution-and-sr-linux/) by [@JulioPDX](https://twitter.com/Julio_PDX) · :material-calendar: 2022-01-22</small>

I’ve been working my way through Optimal Routing Design by Russ White, Don Slice, and Alvaro Retana. It has been a great read so far and I highly recommend it. When I work through a book I usually try and lab up any concept I can, this helps me make it stick as much as possible. Early on in the book the authors mention redistribution and possible issues that can come with doing it at more than one point in the network. So here we are reading this post. I hope you enjoy and possibly learn something along the way.

### My Journey and Experience with Containerlab

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://juliopdx.com/2021/12/10/my-journey-and-experience-with-containerlab/) by [@JulioPDX](https://twitter.com/Julio_PDX) · :material-calendar: 2021-12-10</small>

In [this blog](https://juliopdx.com/2021/12/10/my-journey-and-experience-with-containerlab/) Julio took containerlab for a spin and shares his experience with it. His lab consists of a few Arista cEOS nodes which he then provisions with Nornir, using [Ansible inventory](manual/inventory.md) generated by containerlab.

Discussions: [:material-twitter:](https://twitter.com/Julio_PDX/status/1469562531689631745) · [:material-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6875328740948344832/)

### Building Your Own Data Center Fabric with Containerlab

<small>:material-text::material-youtube: [Blog](https://networkcloudandeverything.com/containerlab-post/) and a [screencast](https://youtu.be/d2f1SYRyj0I) by [Alperen Akpinar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alperenakpinar/) · :material-calendar: 2021-08-24</small>

Alperen did a great job explaining how to build a DC fabric topology using containerlab. This was the first post in the series, making it an excellent intro to containerlab, especially when you follow the [screencast](https://youtu.be/d2f1SYRyj0I) and watch the topology buildup live.

In a [subsequent post](https://networkcloudandeverything.com/configuring-srlinux-nodes-in-a-3-tier-data-center/), Alperen explains how to configure the SR Linux fabric he just built.

### How to consistently run a temporary VM on AWS to run Containerlab

<small>:material-text: [Blog](https://nleiva.medium.com/how-you-can-consistently-run-temporary-workloads-in-the-cloud-37140b4b5e55#8d6d) by [@_nleiva](https://twitter.com/_nleiva) · :material-calendar: 2021-07-12</small>

Create and then destroy a cloud environment ready to Containerlab with pre-loaded topology files, which just work if you use FRR and SR Linux. If you need to run Arista's cEOS, see: [Getting cEOS image](https://github.com/nleiva/aws-testbed/blob/main/lab/get_arista_ceos.md).

This post describes the benefits of running any temporary workload in the cloud to then focus on Containerlab, so skip to the “Network testing challenges” section if you want to get to the meat of it. More details on the labs included at [Network Labs](https://github.com/nleiva/aws-testbed/tree/main/lab#network-labs).
