# Release 0.72

:material-calendar: 2025-12-03 · :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Real-time events streaming

Containerlab 0.72 introduces a new command [`clab events`](../cmd/events.md) command that provides real-time monitoring of your lab infrastructure. This feature streams lifecycle updates for all Containerlab resources and augments them with interface change notifications collected from container network namespaces.

The events command combines Docker's event feed with netlink information, allowing you to observe container activity and interface state changes in real time without selecting a specific lab. This is particularly useful for monitoring dynamic topologies, debugging connectivity issues, and understanding the behavior of your network labs as they evolve - everything [Containerlab VS Code extension](../manual/vsc-extension.md) wanted to have ;)

Thanks @FloSch62 #2898

## Cisco ASAv firewall

With [`cisco_asav`](../manual/kinds/cisco_asav.md) kind Containerlab adds support for the Cisco ASAv (Adaptive Security Appliance Virtual) firewall. This addition includes comprehensive documentation and example labs to get you started quickly.

Thanks @jmreicha #2945

### Cisco vIOS and vIOS-L2

While Cisco vIOS (virtual IOS) and vIOS-L2 (virtual IOS Layer 2) routers have been within Containerlab's ecosystem for a while, we did not have a standalone kind defined for them and leveraged the generic Linux kind. The popularity of these Cisco images warranted dedicated kinds to streamline their usage.

Thanks @torbbang @kaelemc #2902

## Snapshot functionality for vrnetlab nodes

A major workflow enhancement comes in the form of a VM snapshot support for vrnetlab-based VMs. You can now:

- Save VM snapshots with [`clab tools snapshot save`](../cmd/tools/snapshot/save.md)
- Restore from snapshots during deployment with [`clab deploy --restore-all`](../cmd/deploy.md#restore-all)
- Restore specific nodes with `clab deploy --restore node=path`

Snapshots capture the full VM state, enabling fast restoration and significantly speeding up lab iterations. Non-vrnetlab nodes are automatically skipped during snapshot operations.

Thanks @torbbang #2904

## SR-SIM classic CLI support

SR-SIM nodes now support [classic CLI mode](../manual/kinds/sros.md#node-configuration) in addition to the existing default Model-Driven mode. This enhancement provides backward compatibility and allows users to validate transition scenarios when the configuration is upgraded from classic CLI to Model-Driven CLI.

Thanks @schavezc #2916
