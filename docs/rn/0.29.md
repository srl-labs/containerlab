## Checkpoint Cloudguard

Our firewall-focused camp got a new member - [Checkpoint Cloudguard](../manual/kinds/checkpoint_cloudguard.md) platform. This platform is built with [boxen](https://github.com/carlmontanari/boxen) project instead of vrnetlab. We are slowly building confidence in boxen and new platforms will likely be solely powered by boxen. PR #934

## Miscellaneous

* added `-c` shorthand for `--cleanup` flag of the `destroy` command. Now to remove a lab and get rid of the lab directory simply call `clab des -c`.
* [`inspect`](../cmd/inspect/index.md) command has been fixed to display IP information even for nodes connected to external networks.
* added srlinux 6e and 10e platforms
