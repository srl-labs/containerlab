# Juniper vJunosEvolved

[Juniper vJunosEvolved](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/product/us/en/vjunosevolved/) is a virtualized PTX10001 router identified with `-{{ kind_code_name }}-` kind in the [topology file](../topo-def-file.md). It is built using [vrnetlab](../vrnetlab.md) project and essentially is a Qemu VM packaged in a docker container format.

Juniper vJunosEvolved nodes launched with containerlab come up pre-provisioned with SSH, SNMP, NETCONF and gNMI services enabled.

## How to obtain the image

The qcow2 image can be freely downloaded from the [Juniper support portal](https://support.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=vjunos-evolved) without a Juniper account and built with [vrnetlab](../vrnetlab.md).

## Managing Juniper vJunosEvolved nodes

!!!note
    Containers with vJunosEvolved inside will take ~15min to fully boot.  
    You can monitor the progress with `docker logs -f <container-name>`.

Juniper vJunosEvolved node launched with containerlab can be managed via the following interfaces:

=== "bash"
    to connect to a `bash` shell of a running Juniper vJunosEvolved container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name/id> bash
    ```
=== "CLI via SSH"
    to connect to the vJunosEvolved CLI
    ```bash
    ssh admin@<container-name/id>
    ```
=== "NETCONF"
    NETCONF server is running over port 830
    ```bash
    ssh admin@<container-name> -p 830 -s netconf
    ```

!!!info
    Default user credentials: `admin:admin@123`

## Interface naming

You can use [interfaces names](../topo-def-file.md#interface-naming) in the topology file like they appear in -{{ kind_display_name }}-.

The interface naming convention is: `et-0/0/X` (or `ge-0/0/X`, `xe-0/0/X`, all are accepted), where X denotes the port number.

With that naming convention in mind:

* `et-0/0/0` - first data port available
* `et-0/0/1` - second data port, and so on...

/// admonition
    type: note
Data port numbering starts at `0`.
///

The example ports above would be mapped to the following Linux interfaces inside the container running the -{{ kind_display_name }}- VM:

Juniper vJunosEvolved container can have up to 13 interfaces (1 management and 12 data-plane interfaces) and uses the following mapping rules:

* `eth0` - management interface connected to the containerlab management network
* `eth1` - first data interface, mapped to a first data port of vJunosEvolved VM, which is `et-0/0/0` **and not `et-0/0/1`**.
* `eth2+` - second and subsequent data interface

When containerlab launches -{{ kind_display_name }}- node the management interface of the VM gets assigned `10.0.0.15/24` address from the QEMU DHCP server. This interface is transparently stitched with container's `eth0` interface such that users can reach the management plane of the -{{ kind_display_name }}- using containerlab's assigned IP.

Data interfaces `et-0/0/0+` need to be configured with IP addressing manually using CLI or other available management interfaces.

## Features and options

### Node configuration

Juniper vJunosEvolved nodes come up with a basic configuration supplied by a mountable configuration disk to the main VM image. Users, management interfaces, and protocols such as SSH and NETCONF are configured.

#### Startup configuration

It is possible to make vJunosEvolved nodes boot up with a user-defined startup-config instead of a built-in one. With a [`startup-config`](../nodes.md#startup-config) property of the node/kind user sets the path to the config file that will be mounted to a container and used as a startup-config:

```yaml
topology:
  nodes:
    node:
      kind: juniper_vjunosevolved
      startup-config: myconfig.txt
```

With this knob containerlab is instructed to take a file `myconfig.txt` from the directory that hosts the topology file, and copy it to the lab directory for that specific node under the `/config/startup-config.cfg` name. Then the directory that hosts the startup-config dir is mounted to the container. This will result in this config being applied at startup by the node.

Configuration is applied after the node is started, thus it can contain partial configuration snippets that you desire to add on top of the default config that a node boots up with.

## Lab examples

The following labs feature the Juniper vJunosEvolved node:

* [SR Linux and Juniper vJunosEvolved](../../lab-examples/srl-vjunosevolved.md)

## Known issues and limitations

* To check the boot log, use `docker logs -f <node-name>`.
