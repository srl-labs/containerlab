  $ yourprogram completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/yourprogram

Zsh:

  # If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,

  $ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  $ yourprogram completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_yourprogram"

  # You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

fish:

  $ yourprogram completion fish | source

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  $ yourprogram completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/yourprogram.fish

PowerShell:

  PS> yourprogram completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

  # To load completions for every new session, run:

	// completionCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
