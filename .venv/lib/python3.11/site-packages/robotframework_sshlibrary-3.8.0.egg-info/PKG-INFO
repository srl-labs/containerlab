SSHLibrary
===============

.. contents::

Introduction
------------

SSHLibrary_ is a `Robot Framework`_ test
library for SSH and SFTP.  The project is hosted on GitHub_
and downloads can be found from PyPI_.

SSHLibrary is operating system independent and supports Python 2.7 as well
as Python 3.4 or newer. In addition to the normal Python_ interpreter,
it also works with `Jython 2.7`_.

The library has the following main usages:

- Executing commands on the remote machine, either with blocking or
  non-blocking behavior.
- Writing and reading in an interactive shell.
- Transferring files and directories over SFTP.
- Ensuring that files and directories exist on the remote machine.

Documentation
-------------

See `keyword documentation`_ for available keywords and more information
about the library in general.

For general information about using test libraries with Robot Framework, see
`Robot Framework User Guide`_.

Installation
------------

The recommended installation method is using pip_::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-sshlibrary

Running this command installs also the latest Robot Framework, paramiko_
and scp_ versions. The minimum supported paramiko version is ``1.15.3`` and
minimum supported scp version is ``0.13.0``.
The ``--upgrade`` option can be omitted when installing the library for the
first time.

With recent versions of ``pip`` it is possible to install directly from the
GitHub_ repository. To install latest source from the master branch, use
this command::

    pip install git+https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary.git

Alternatively you can download the source distribution from PyPI_, extract
it, and install it using one of the following depending are you using
Python or Jython::

    python setup.py install
    jython setup.py install

A benefit of using pip is that it automatically installs scp, paramiko
and Cryptography_ modules (or PyCrypto_ if paramiko version < 2.0)
that SSHLibrary requires on Python.

On Jython, SSHLibrary requires Trilead SSH JAR distribution. You need to download
`Trilead SSH JAR distribution`_ and add it to CLASSPATH.

On Windows operating system, when using Python version < 3.0, SSHLibrary will
require win_inet_pton_. The minimum supported win_inet_pton version is ``1.1.0``.

For creating SSH tunnels robotbackgroundlogger_ > 1.2 is also a requirement.

Docker
~~~~~~

When installing SSHLibrary in a container (eg. Alpine Linux) there are more dependencies
that must be installed: gcc_, make_, openssl-dev_, musl-dev_ and libffi-dev_. These
packages can be installed using::

    apk add gcc make openssl-dev musl-dev libffi-dev

Usage
-----

To use SSHLibrary in Robot Framework tests, the library needs to first be
imported using the Library setting as any other library.

When using Robot Framework, it is generally recommended to write as
easy-to-understand tests as possible. The keywords provided by
SSHLibrary are pretty low level and it is typically a good idea to
write tests using Robot Framework's higher level keywords that utilize
SSHLibrary keywords internally. This is illustrated by the following example
where SSHLibrary keywords like ``Open Connection`` and ``Login`` are grouped
together in a higher level keyword like ``Open Connection And Log In``.
