# Release 0.67

:material-calendar: 2025-04-01 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Share access to lab nodes

Lightweight, fast to deploy, and reproducible containerlabs are meant to be shared via Git. But sometimes, you can't quite share the entire lab... Maybe the recipient doesn't have access to the container images or has other limitations that prevent them from running a copy of you lab.

Yet, you might find yourself in need to share access of your lab with one or many users. Quite often you want someone else to have a look at your lab when you found something or got stuck. Or maybe you are a lecturer and want to broadcast your lab interaction to your students.

Checkout the web-based on-demand lab access sharing [using sshx](../manual/share-access.md).

## Nornir inventory support

Thanks to @danlindow, Containerlab will now [generate Nornir' Simple Inventory](../manual/inventory.md#nornir) right next to the Ansible inventory. This opens up a door to your reusing your existing automation stacks built with Nornir.

## Miscellaneous

* docker version you get installed when using the quick-setup script has been bumped to 27.5.1
* added openwrt kind support (no docs yet)
* new SR Linux types - `ixr18e` and `ixrh432d`
* delete process won't require lab dir presence anymore
* bumped required Go version to 1.23
