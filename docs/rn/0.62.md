# Release 0.61

:material-calendar: 2025-01-17 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Lab Directory path

No one will miss the old behavior of creating [the lab directory](../manual/conf-artifacts.md#identifying-a-lab-directory) in the current working directory. Now we are changing the behavior so that the lab directory is created in the directory where the topology file is located.

Why we did not do this from the beginning? Who knows...

## Public keys export

Containerlab has this super power of fetching your public keys and provisioning them to the supported nodes (Nokia SR Linux and SR OS at this point[^1]).

The extracted keys will now also be visible in the topology export file available in your Lab Directory so that external systems parsing this file could use the public keys if needed.

## Command line completions

A feature that is typically used by power users, but that blows the socks off of regular users. Command line completions. We had it for a very long time, but this time around we revisited the documentation to make sure the snippets still work and also support the shorthand `clab` alias.

[Go check it out.](../cmd/completion.md)
